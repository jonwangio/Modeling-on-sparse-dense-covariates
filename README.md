# On the discussion of sparse measurements interpolation with dense grid covariate(s)
-------------------


Introduction
-------------------
The attempt to recover a complete continuous random field based upon only a few point measurements/observations is fascinating! Humans are taking such attempt to almost any scale in the pursuit of science and art. Using few boreholes for a geographer to [_Krige_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging) the distribution of gold is no different from a sculptor using a point machine to sample out the shape of Bernini's masterpiece [_The Rape of Proserpina_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rape_of_Proserpina). For both scientists and artists, accuracy is the prime.
Using Earth Observation (EO) data as a complement or even replacement of ground-based sparse measurements is prevalent in many mapping activities, relevant ones can be soil, humidity, pollutants, particles, energy and etc.. Such application of EO data in understanding and interpreting geographic processes becomes universal along the increasing availability of satellite imagery data, which entitles the interpolating point measurements assisted by gridded imagery data as a scientific problem.
